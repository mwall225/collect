# Collect
Collect is a gem for connecting [ODK Collect](https://docs.getodk.org/collect-intro/) forms to a Rails application.



## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'collect', github: 'SistematicaHN/collect', branch: 'main'
```
Run bundle install.
```bash
$ bundle install
```
Run the generator to add the default configuration.
```bash
$ rails g collect:install
```
Migrate the database.
```bash
$ rails db:migrate
```
Collect requires Active Storage to be installed. So if you don't have Active Storage installed run:
```bash
$ rails active_storage:install
$ rails db:migrate
```
You will need an environment variable defined as "DOMAIN".
`DOMAIN` is the domain your app uses.
For example:
```
DOMAIN: "https://96fdf8f744b6g.ngrok.io"
```
Add the 'crack' and 'responders',  gem to your app's gemfile.
```bash
gem 'crack'
gem 'responders'
```
Run bundle install:
```bash
$ bundle install
```
Then, install responders.
```bash
$ rails g responders:install
```
You should be all set to go at this point.

localhost:3000/collect/forms
